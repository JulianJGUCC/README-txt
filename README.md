Analysis: The problem for this program is to ensure that the user enters a valid password as a string while following specific rules. Input was used in variable password to display "Enter Password". An input of the correct password would output "valid password" while an incorrect password displays "Invalid password". Output commands such as print were used in the IF and ELIF statements.
Design: While true loop was firstly used because of the password being user input. Next came variable "password" which stored an input message to the user to eneter a password. To follow the specific rules that were given, a conditional statement using IF was used as followed: IF password == (abcde123). If the statement proved to be true, a message would be displayed to the user's screen as "valid password". The break function would be used before the ELIF statement so that the loop wouldnt continue after every valid user input. The elif statement would then be used after the break becuase the user would input an "invalid password" that wis displayed on the screen.
Testing: The program was saved and prepared to run using IDLE Shell.
